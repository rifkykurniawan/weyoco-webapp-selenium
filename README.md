# First Setup Web Automation Using Selenium!

Selenium is a popular open-source testing framework used for automating web browsers. It allows you to write scripts that can interact with web elements, simulate user actions (like clicking, typing, scrolling), and verify expected behaviors across different browsers.

Selenium is widely used in:
- Automated testing of web applications
- Web scraping and data extraction
- Browser automation tasks
